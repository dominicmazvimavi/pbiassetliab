<h1>Power BI - Asset & Liability Monitor Model</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
I have developed a Power BI model designed to monitor the daily values and daily value differences of assets and liabilities for our organization. The primary goal is to proactively notify the development team of any anomalies detected in the data, enabling us to investigate the issues before they impact end-users. To achieve this, automated alerts have been set up using Power Automate, which sends email notifications to members of the development team when asset and/or liability values fall outside their expected range.

Beyond anomaly detection, this Power BI model also serves as a valuable tool for end-users of ALM (Asset Liability Management) by providing them with a user-friendly platform to quickly access asset and liability values.
